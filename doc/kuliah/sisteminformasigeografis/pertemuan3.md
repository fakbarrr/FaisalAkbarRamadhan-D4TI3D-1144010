Background
A geographic information system or called (GIS) That there are 2 data and it is a spatial data, geospatial vector data and geospatial raster data. Data vektordapat depicts an Earth with lines, polygons and points, with With it we can find the number of cities, islands or several locations by using this vector data.
Vector Data is data that displays a pattern of dots, curves, lines or polygons. Vector data contained in the class, the shapefile or shp.
Shapefile is a data format that is intended geospatial software (GIS) or a geographic information system.
System System to take into account or misinterpreting a small city or island who did not pitch kanatau we map the unknown more easily as it seems to me simple python.
In shp shapefile or there are several methods, namely, the method Reader and shape. Reader and the method used to read the data on file shp, makasebab that we can dile of shp it.
To view data shapefile using Python, Pyshp, and pip that can be run in CMD or at the terminal in windows and even then if use windows for Linux users and others equally find terminals that can run the commands.
Conclusion
I think the conclusion is that we can see the data or the number of his contained in the shapefile quite easy because it can be done with a CMD or terminal located in the windows or else her.
Suggestion:
The advice I gave learn python, pip pyshp and therefore we can easily determine the number of cities and the use of it with CMD.
